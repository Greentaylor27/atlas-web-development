# <head> tag

In this project we will be following along with the Atlas WW1000 <head> Tag project. Metadata is important as it helps structure the HTML and optimize performance and SEO. To my understanding of this project this is a way for the instructor (Max) to get to know his students.


## Lessons Learned

We will be learning about the <head> tag, Which is essential for setting up Metadata and resources for a webpage. The <head> tag contains elements like the document title, links to stylesheets, and scripts.
