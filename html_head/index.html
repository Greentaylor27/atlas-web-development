    <h1> Introduction </h1>
    <p> Hello my name is Taylor Green. (He/Him/They) </p>
    <p> I'm really excited to have finally made it to T3 after all the hard work I've put in since starting Atlas (formerly known as Holberton) </p>
    <h2> Some Things That Interest Me</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> I have a lot of hobbies outside of School some of them include </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Warhammer</li>
        <li>Card games (Magic, Universus, etc.)</li>
        <li>Painting minis</li>
        <li>Hanging out with my wife, daughter and soon to be son</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why I choose Atlas</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        I choose Atlas because I've always attempted to learning coding on my own and could never stick with it.
        I attempted for me years on my own, then I made a friend who had been attending Holberton and he told me a bit more about it and I decided to give it a try and I haven't regretted it since.
        I've met some wonderful people with this school and not only has it taught me a lot of technical skills it has taught me a lot of personal skills.
    </p>

    <h2>Something I'm looking forward to this Trimester</h2>
    <p>
        I'm really looking forward to be creative, (I was told T3 is a lot of front-end).
        I'm looking forward to honing my technical skills and giving myself a push this trimester to do better than any trimester I've done before.
        I'm also looking forward to being more active in discussions with not only my peers but also with staff to.
    </p>
    <h3> What I want to do with my skill and Why FS </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        So the first part of that question is a hard one to answer.
        I'd love to do something in the gaming industry (Video games or Physical games like card games and board games).
        What that entails I'm uncertain of at the moment as I've not really thought that far ahead of what the end all be all is.
        Why'd I choose FS, to be honest I was uncertain for the longest time what I wanted to go into, so they placed me in the FS program.
        in T1 we spoke with the instructors about specs and Derreck made a great point, "Go on indeed or linkedin and look at the job postings of your spec not only should that be a factor, FS as a concept is so general you can take it and go anywhere with it."
        So I decided to stay in FS.
